Climate change is an imminent global challenge, necessitating urgent attention and effective strategies for mitigation. This study explores the intricate dynamics of climate
change using machine learning models and time series analysis to predict temperature trends. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset spanning over 150 years, the research
focuses on maximum temperature variations in various regions of the UK, centering on Oxford.

The study employs advanced regression models, including Random Forest Regression, Linear Regression, and the specialized time series forecasting technique, Prophet.
The Linear Regression model emerges as the optimal choice through meticulous evaluation and comparison, exhibiting consistently superior performance across essential metrics. The results substantially enhance comprehension of climate dynamics, shedding
light on the interplay between meteorological parameters and temperature variations. These insights are vital for policymakers, environmentalists, and researchers, enabling informed decision-making in tackling climate change challenges. While acknowledging limitations, such as excluding specific meteorological features and external
variables, the research opens avenues for future exploration, suggesting incorporating additional factors and ensemble techniques for more comprehensive temperature
prediction models.

The studyâ€™s outcomes extend beyond academia, carrying substantial implications for practical applications. Accurate temperature prediction models are pivotal in addressing
climate change concerns. The research underscores the potential of machine learning in climate science, facilitating early warning systems, informed policy formulation,
and sustainable decision-making. In conclusion, this study not only contributes to the field of climate prediction but also offers valuable insights and directions for advancing
temperature forecasting models and addressing the pressing issues of climate change.
