# Climate-Change
Abstract: 
Introduction:
Climate, distinct from weather due to its emphasis on long-term trends over day-to-day fluctuations, is undergoing significant change. Climate change is a reality that demands immediate attention and effective strategies to mitigate its impact. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is made up of scientists from all across the world. These researchers discovered that the burning of fossil fuels, which emits carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, is to blame for the average 1.1° Celsius (almost 2°F) increase in global surface air temperature between 1900 and 2020. While the numeric change might appear relatively modest, this warming trend is unparalleled when compared to temperature records spanning over two millennia [1] This dissertation delves into the intricate interplay between anthropogenic modifications and natural dynamics, utilizing observations and models to comprehend the historical, current, and future ramifications of climate change.[6] With a focus on escalating temperatures, the urgency of informed mitigation strategies becomes evident. 
Like other countries, the United Kingdom has to contend with the effects of climate change. Weather forecasting in the UK is a complex endeavor marked by its inherent difficulties. The unpredictable and chaotic nature of weather introduces a significant sensitivity to initial conditions, rendering accurate forecasts a challenging pursuit. The journey toward precision is constrained not only by model inaccuracies but also by the errors inherent in measuring initial conditions. [2]Given the scale of its impact, the field of weather forecasting has dedicated considerable human resources and computational power over the past few decades. The outcomes of these endeavors are noteworthy. The British Meteorological Service (2017) asserts that their current four-day forecasts are as accurate as one-day forecasts were three decades ago. This advancement in forecast accuracy aligns with the general trend that forecast horizons have expanded by about one day per decade [3]. These improvements in accuracy have profound implications, especially considering the extensive reliance on weather predictions across the UK. Bauer, Thorpe, and Brunet (2015) contend that the influence of weather forecasts rivals that of any other physical science. The consistent enhancement of forecast accuracy resonates with the growing dependence of individuals, businesses, and governments on reliable weather predictions, ultimately shaping and guiding numerous aspects of society in the UK.[3]
Amid this context, this study leverages machine learning techniques to predict climate data, focusing on maximum temperature trends in diverse UK regions, with Oxford as the epicenter. Utilizing an extensive dataset provided by Met Office UK, spanning from the mid-19th century to the present, the study endeavors to provide crucial insights into historical temperature trends and patterns. The ability to forecast future climate statistics assumes critical importance, aiding environmentalists and policymakers in adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change.[4] With a concentrated emphasis on the UK, this research aims to harness the power of machine learning to forecast and comprehend future climate metrics, aligning with the broader effort to foster sustainability.
The research methodology encompasses a comprehensive analytical framework, incorporating advanced regression models such as the Random Forest Regressor and Linear Regression, complemented by the specialized time series forecasting technique known as Prophet, developed by Facebook. The Random Forest Regressor adeptly captures complex relationships within climate determinants, while Linear Regression offers insights into linear connections. The incorporation of the Prophet technique enhances temporal trend capture, considering holidays and recurring patterns that influence climate variables. These techniques synergistically enhance prediction accuracy and depth, enabling valuable insights across various sectors and decision-making processes.
Within this context, the study embarks on an experimental evaluation, delving into the prediction efficacy of the employed models. The research explores key elements of temperature change data for each region, laying the foundation for the ensuing analysis. The endeavor seeks not only to forecast climate metrics but also to enhance our understanding of climate dynamics, thus shaping a better-informed approach to climate adaptation and policy formulation. Through the exploration of historical temperature records and the application of cutting-edge modeling techniques, this research advances our comprehension of climate change's impact on the UK region and beyond, contributing to the collective efforts aimed at ensuring a sustainable and resilient future.
