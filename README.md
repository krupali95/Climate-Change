# Climate-Change
Abstract: 
Introduction:
Climate, distinct from weather due to its emphasis on long-term trends over day-to-day fluctuations, is undergoing significant change. Climate change is a reality that demands immediate attention and effective strategies to mitigate its impact. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is made up of scientists from all across the world. These researchers discovered that the burning of fossil fuels, which emits carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, is to blame for the average 1.1° Celsius (almost 2°F) increase in global surface air temperature between 1900 and 2020. While the numeric change might appear relatively modest, this warming trend is unparalleled when compared to temperature records spanning over two millennia [1] This dissertation delves into the intricate interplay between anthropogenic modifications and natural dynamics, utilizing observations and models to comprehend the historical, current, and future ramifications of climate change.[6] With a focus on escalating temperatures, the urgency of informed mitigation strategies becomes evident. 
Like other countries, the United Kingdom has to contend with the effects of climate change. Weather forecasting in the UK is a complex endeavor marked by its inherent difficulties. The unpredictable and chaotic nature of weather introduces a significant sensitivity to initial conditions, rendering accurate forecasts a challenging pursuit. The journey toward precision is constrained not only by model inaccuracies but also by the errors inherent in measuring initial conditions. [2]Given the scale of its impact, the field of weather forecasting has dedicated considerable human resources and computational power over the past few decades. The outcomes of these endeavors are noteworthy. The British Meteorological Service (2017) asserts that their current four-day forecasts are as accurate as one-day forecasts were three decades ago. This advancement in forecast accuracy aligns with the general trend that forecast horizons have expanded by about one day per decade [3]. These improvements in accuracy have profound implications, especially considering the extensive reliance on weather predictions across the UK. Bauer, Thorpe, and Brunet (2015) contend that the influence of weather forecasts rivals that of any other physical science. The consistent enhancement of forecast accuracy resonates with the growing dependence of individuals, businesses, and governments on reliable weather predictions, ultimately shaping and guiding numerous aspects of society in the UK.[3]
Amid this context, this study leverages machine learning techniques to predict climate data, focusing on maximum temperature trends in diverse UK regions, with Oxford as the epicenter. Utilizing an extensive dataset provided by Met Office UK, spanning from the mid-19th century to the present, the study endeavors to provide crucial insights into historical temperature trends and patterns. The ability to forecast future climate statistics assumes critical importance, aiding environmentalists and policymakers in adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change.[4] With a concentrated emphasis on the UK, this research aims to harness the power of machine learning to forecast and comprehend future climate metrics, aligning with the broader effort to foster sustainability.
The research methodology encompasses a comprehensive analytical framework, incorporating advanced regression models such as the Random Forest Regressor and Linear Regression, complemented by the specialized time series forecasting technique known as Prophet, developed by Facebook. The Random Forest Regressor adeptly captures complex relationships within climate determinants, while Linear Regression offers insights into linear connections. The incorporation of the Prophet technique enhances temporal trend capture, considering holidays and recurring patterns that influence climate variables. These techniques synergistically enhance prediction accuracy and depth, enabling valuable insights across various sectors and decision-making processes.
Within this context, the study embarks on an experimental evaluation, delving into the prediction efficacy of the employed models. The research explores key elements of temperature change data for each region, laying the foundation for the ensuing analysis. The endeavor seeks not only to forecast climate metrics but also to enhance our understanding of climate dynamics, thus shaping a better-informed approach to climate adaptation and policy formulation. Through the exploration of historical temperature records and the application of cutting-edge modeling techniques, this research advances our comprehension of climate change's impact on the UK region and beyond, contributing to the collective efforts aimed at ensuring a sustainable and resilient future.

This section delves into the diverse landscape of climate forecasting techniques employing regressor and prophet methodologies:

The realm of weather forecasting research has witnessed a panorama of investigations into predictive models. Mathur et al. (2008) laid the foundation with a feature-based neural network, envisioning it as an alternative to conventional meteorological methods. In 2012, the utilization of backpropagation neural networks unlocked the potential to capture intricate nonlinear temperature relationships.[1] Troncoso et al. (2015) carved a path by employing innovative regression tree structures, culminating in accurate short-term wind speed forecasts. These studies collectively illuminate the exploration of avant-garde approaches in weather prediction, from neural networks unraveling intricate connections to specialized regression trees enhancing wind speed predictions.[2]

Marzban, Leyton, and Colman (2007) embarked on an extensive analysis of cloud ceiling and visibility data across the Pacific Northwest from 2001 to 2005. Their focus was to prognosticate the likelihood of low or high cloud ceilings over a 6 to 12-hour forecast horizon. The exploration spanned 39 weather stations, revealing neural networks' superior predictive prowess over Model Output Statistics (MOS) and logistic regression, for stations with sufficient data. It's noteworthy that individual station results are depicted graphically, while comprehensive summary statistics remain absent [Reference: Provided source]. Notably, for six-hour predictions, neural networks outperformed MOS on 9 out of 14 stations, with a 64% success rate. For twelve-hour forecasts, neural networks outshone MOS on all 34 stations (100%), hinting that non-linear methods outshine linear ones when predicting non-linear trends manifesting as forecasting biases over extended intervals. These findings posit the dominance of non-linear techniques in day-ahead weather predictions, aligning with the present study's objectives.[3]

Background:
In this section, we provide an in-depth exploration of the methodologies employed in this study, their alignment with the research problem, and the theoretical foundations that underpin their usage. The methodologies encompass Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, hyperparameter tuning, and the utilization of the Facebook Prophet library for time series forecasting.

Dataset: 
This study's analysis was derived from the Met Office's comprehensive repository of historic station data, available through the public domain at https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/maps-and-data/historic-station-data. This repository has proven invaluable for examining transformations in the UK's climate over the span of more than 150 years. The central objective of this endeavor was to uncover patterns within climate variations, with a specific focus on temperature fluctuations, across distinct temporal intervals. Significantly, the dataset in question encompasses meticulously archived historical climate records, an extensive collection amassed by the Met Office. The analysis specifically narrowed its scope to the Oxford region, considering monthly temperature metrics in degrees Celsius. This dataset encompasses a range from 1853 to July 2023 and encompasses pivotal variables including 'year,' 'month,' 'tmax,' 'tmin,' 'af' (indicating air frost recorded in each month), 'rainfall,' and 'sun.' Notably, the 'sun' column, deemed irrelevant to the analysis due to its limited informational value, was prudently excluded from the subsequent analytical processes.

For the initial regression analysis, a series of meticulous transformations were performed during the preprocessing phase to ensure data consistency and facilitate subsequent analyses. The temporal variables 'year' and 'month' were converted into integer representations, while other pertinent columns underwent conversion to float values, enabling Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) due to their original object data type. An additional column, 'tavg,' was introduced to enrich insights. This calculated the average of 'tmax' and 'tmin,' thereby providing a more visual representation and enhanced differentiability. To address the presence of missing data points, a pivotal step in this preparatory phase, the versatile 'fillna()' function was strategically employed. This judicious utilization revitalized the dataset, ensuring that it was robust and complete. A paramount consideration was the meticulous preservation of the temporal sequence, a feat accomplished through meticulous data-driven imputation techniques. By harmonizing these transformational steps, the data preparation phase established a sturdy foundation for ensuing analyses, seamlessly aligning with the overarching objectives of the study.

Transitioning to the time series modeling aspect, a distinctive approach emerged. This necessitated the inclusion of a 'day' column, as the input structure required by the Prophet framework invariably consists of two core columns: 'ds' (datestamp) and 'y' (numeric measurement for forecasting). Adhering to the expected Pandas format, 'ds' was converted into a datetime represenDateTimewherein the day component was consistently set to '01,' remaining congruent with the original dataset's month and year specifications. This coherent structure, exemplified as (01-01-1853, 01-02-1853, and so on), served as the bedrock for the subsequent phases of the modeling process.
